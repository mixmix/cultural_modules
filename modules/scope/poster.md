Scope
=====

We can't do everything - some things do not belong here

1. Define the scope of the meeting or project
2. Notice if the group goes outside the scope
3. Check: "Is this out of scope?"
4. Set aside stuff that's out of scope for another time
5. Focus on the agreed scope

Why?
----

It's easy to get distracted, or to take on too much at once. Feeling pressured to solve all problem at once is stressful. It's usually more effective to define what you're working on in a focused way, and set aside other things for a while.

Warnings
--------

- Sometimes problems are interrelated. Don't ignore complexity. If understanding the context is important, map out the connections and then pick a specific scope to start with.
- Sometimes out of scope things that come up are also important. Don't lose them. Write them down and review them later.
- Be willing to critique your scope. Maybe you defined it wrong in the first place. As understanding of the work evolves, so will the scope.
