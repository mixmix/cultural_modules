Check In Round
==============

Hear from everyone as part of arriving

1. Specify a prompt like "What's on top for you?" or "How are you as a person?" or "What are you hoping to get out of this session?"
2. Go around and hear from each person in turn, without allowing interruptions
3. Begin the meeting

People need some time to settle and arrive, in order to listen to one another and collaborate well. 

**Warnings**
- Be clear about expectations about time keeping during the round, so everyone takes roughly the same amount. If you have limited time, you might have to keep it very short. If you want long and deep discussion, you might want it to be very extensive.
