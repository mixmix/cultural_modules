---

### Can you give me an example of an agreement you made that went badly/ well?

We're now an association, because we needed a legal entity. Nobody profits from what happens there, everyone is expected to 
It's not co-woring, because we don't have central management or profit

Established by 70 people, 22, companies. We shared a purpose : work in a more collaborative way, and to appreciate profit in a broader perspective, we're not toally money driven. We all want to make a positive impact.

One company rented a couple of buildings, we spent 4 days discussing and designing the space. We then needed money to make the changes, which we crowd-funded among ourslves. Minimum block amount people could contribute would be $2000. We raised $250K, which we agreed we would pay back in a year, and agreed that interest was less than bank but more than savings. This was our first agreement, and we paid it back in 10 months.

That took a lot of financial controlling. Everyone is expected to work for the space, but nobody gets paid to do that. We divide ourselves into workgroups (e.g. comms, sustainability, events, finances, ..)

We have open weekly meetings, and docuemented in shared Google Drive.
We have a regular general assembaly which is closed to the public, and everyone is expected to attend. have to have 80% agreement to make decisions. 
Some of these meetings are 8 hours. We call these meetings a Pulse meeting

**Derek:** tell me about the structure of the general assembly
- timekeeper
- agenda-master
- notetaker
- speaking-watcher

people have until friday at noon to get into the agenda. meeting starts at 6pm.

### Example: how you came to agreement about where you can smoke cigarettes?

- when we began we had weekly meetings
- we noticed there was tension between smokers and non-smokers
- we proposed to debate this in the general meeting ( email: topic, estimated breakdown of time for sub-agenda ) 
    + the timekeeper interupts and asks community to decide : longer / finish next time. 
      - we vote by hand-voting, and count for 80% 
    + at the start our meetings were unstructured and we didn't have the oppertunity to have more time to think. We noticed the issue just came up again the next time.
      - we announce when there is going to be a decision made at a Pulse Meeting.
      - if you can't make it you have to email ahead of the meeting and send it to everyone. And each person can only represent on person. (=transparency, clear hats, enough diversity in the room - ensures 50% of the community in the room)

We spent 5 days in the countryside with facilitators to develop these rules. 

General Assembly / Pulse Meeting is used for decissions : 
  - specific policies 
  - operation of the general meeting
        
**Derek:** we're really interested in how you hack your organisational code


### Example: discussing why we can't use foundation name to earn money

context: grant proposals, writing reports, accountability

it took us 3 meetings 
we noticed that brand damage was the main topic, and 

solution: very rigid structure
  meeting with 80% of the 70 members and total consensus for approval to use name of association
  agreed format 
    - min 3 people (so 2 backups) - to bottom-line finance
    - who's in the workgroup(s)
    - report is presented internally first before sign-off


**Derek:** what happens if the that team messes up?
the community has agreed to the risk, so we share the responsibility.

**Derek:** under what conditions can someone be asked to leave?
There isn't one. We have had a big fight where someone ended up leaving. 


### Example: hiring someone to do architecture during build

We hired an internal person for the architect. The job wasn't finished, he asked for more money. 
Aguement was about valuation of work (have same discount internally as us)

He could have asked for help but he didn't.
We noticed after that he fought with 3-4 other places and he's leaving the community.

I think it wasn't an issue with the community, but we learnt a lot about this sort of work

**Derek:** sounds like there was a clear contract with the community
- yes, in the middle he started changing the rates
- we found out he was mis-using the money

- even then we didn't expell him, we understood it was a one time thing and this is within a community

In the begining without the association moving money wasn't easy, so we had people using personal account to collect money. Someone used community money for personal need.
We already had a structure for asking for loans. We sat down and changed plans, set clear expectations, but he paid back, and is still a valuale member of our community.

**Mix:** how do people join, that sounds like a great arrangement and aweseme community

- _Amigoma_: Friend relationship (max 3 times a week) - friend by paying a small monthly fee. This gets you a discount on meeting spaces, workshops, you get full access to the info.
- _Holazinio_: More regular (max 3 times a week) - you pay - same plus you pay more, can propose things, you get a locker, you can use the meetings rooms as much as you want. You are no allowed to have a fixed table. Not allowed store room.
- _Resident_: Every day of the week, you have a desk, you can use the meeting rooms as much as you want. Mandatory voting at general meetings, names on contracts. People expect you participate in community.

70 ~= 48 residents, 8 Amigomas, rest Holazinio

**Mix:** how did you come to this structure/ arrangement?

The first two were residents + Halazinio : people shared a purpose and the complimentary companies, we wanted to support each other and debate economics etc. We wanted to make good things for the general community, not just us.
Holazinio are freelancers and companies

**Mix:** Where did the Amigoma come from?

We noticed there were people who wanted to be around us, because they know what we do, but didn't necessarily want to work in the space. They had no structure. People know they can come in a, and there are some open meetings and there is a bar.
We currently don't put that out that much


**Mix:** How does the space accounting get done?

There is a work group for finances (3 people). These people are responsible, they have weekly meetings + reports. These reports are open so you can see who paid, and who didn't.
this is an unpaid job. 
we have one person who is hired who to do 2 days of manual data entry, but the people in the work group are the ones that are responsible for the job getting done.

We also have this process of employing for cleaning

**Derek:** when you need to hire someone, do you take that to the general assembly

yes

**Mix:** how long is your average general meeting?

2 hours generally, tops 3 hours. Sometimes 4 hours if there's something really complicated about money.
These meetings are really important for building your sense of community - not only for building rules. 

We actually keep these running because it keep community spirit up. One week open, one week closed.

Generally drinking is ok. 
If anyone is uncomfortable, they can suggest that we shouldn't drink during the meeting. We then discuss this and do a more casual vote on this.
